Practical No: 8


• Aim: Configure NIS in order to share user accounts in your local network.


• Description:

1. NIS stands for Network Information Systems.
2. NIS, or Network Information Systems, is a network service that allows authentication and login information to be stored on a centrally located server. 
3. This includes the username and password database for login authentication, database of user groups, and the locations of home directories.
4. NIS-sharing flat files (sharing resources).
5. Files stored on certain machines, kind of database, can be queried, in tabular form, at least one column should be there.
6. It is kind of kind of database in which each table has unique key, one or more column.
7. And with query we need to identify it.

   There are 2 types:
   a. Master – Main Server
   b. Slave – Secondary server, load balancing
If master server goes down then the Slave can take over Master server.

8. Client can join without server acceptance


• Steps and Commands:

1. First update kali:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo apt-get update
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo apt update

2. Now install NIS:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo apt-get install -y nis

3. Now user must configure NIS:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/default/nis

- After opening /etc/default/nis file scroll down and see-
# Are we a NIS server and if so what kind (values: false, slave, master)?

- And write:
NISSERVER=master

- And then scroll below 
# Are we a NIS client?

- And write:
NISCLIENT=false

4. Take copy of NIS:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo cp /etc/default/nis /etc/default/nis_client

5. In /etc/ypserv.securenets, we need to write our IP address and subnet mask:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/ypserv.securenets

6. Now for gmake (GNU make - called simply make on Linux systems) is a tool to help you build a program from its source.
   shibu@kali:~$ which gmake
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo dpkg -S `which gmake`

7. Now start & check the status of ypserv:

- ypserv: yellow pages (directory), it's a server where a client can query to see what service is there. 
- ypbind: Client binds tools 
- ypxfrd: nis database is with master, this command sends the database to the slave (secondary server) - load balancing

   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start ypserv
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status ypserv

8. Now run the yp:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

9. Now start & check status of NIS:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start nis
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status nis

10. Restart and check status of rpcbind NIS:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl restart rpcbind nis
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status rpcbind nis

11. Now we need to Add a user:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo adduser shibu9

12. Now to make your user:
    shibu@kali:~$ cd /var/yp
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo make

13. Now add a hostname in /etc/host: (I’ve added kali.shibu )
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/hosts

14. In /etc/yp.conf/ write the domain and server
    In my case I’ve written domain as Shibu and server as kali.shibu

    shibu@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/yp.conf

15. Now, do $ ls -lrth
    shibu@kali:~$ cat ypservers

16. Now do hosts.byname name to see all your host name & domain name
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo cat hosts.byname
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo domainname
 
17. Now ping, just to check everything’s working:
    shibu@kali:~$ ping kali
    shibu@kali:~$ ping shibu.com
    shibu@kali:~$ ping kali.shibu

18. Now again run the yp:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

19. Now configure nsswitch.conf for NIS:
- The Name Service Switch (NSS) configuration file, /etc/nsswitch.conf, is used by the GNU C Library and certain other applications 
  to determine the sources from which to obtain name-service information in a range of categories, and in what order.  
  
- Each category of information is identified by a database name.

    shibu@kali:~$ sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf

20. Now reboot Kali and Login with the user that we have added above:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo reboot

21. If Login is successful then NIS server is working.
