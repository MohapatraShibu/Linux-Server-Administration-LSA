Practical No: 5

• Aim: Install Samba to share folders or files between Windows and Linux.


• Description:

1. Samba is an open source implementation of the Server Message Block/Common Internet File System (SMB/CIFS) protocol suite.

2. Samba transparently provides file and print sharing services to Windows clients as well as other networked clients running other operating systems. 

3. It does this through the use of the native Microsoft networking protocols SMB/CIFS. 

4. From a system administrator’s point of view, 
   this means you can deploy a Linux/UNIX-based server without having to install Network File System (NFS) and some kind of 
   Linux/UNIX compatible authentication support on all the Windows clients in the network.

5. Instead, the clients can use their native tongue to talk to the server—which means fewer hassles for you and seamless integration for your users.


• Steps and commands (Kali Linux part):

1. First we need to install Samba Server:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install samba

2. Then we need to start samba service:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start smbd

3. Then we need to check the status samba service:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status smbd

4. Then we need to start nmbd service:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start nmbd

5. Then we need to start nmbd service:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd

6. First we make a samba_shared directory in /home/shibu  

7. Then we make few txt files in /home/shibu/samba_shared 
   shibu@kali:~$ touch a.txt b.txt c.txt

8. Now,
   shibu@kali:~$ cd /etc/samba
   shibu@kali:~$ ls /etc/samba

9. Now take the backup of smb.conf 
   shibu@kali:~$ cp smb.conf smb.conf_bkp 

10. Now we need to do few configuration in /etc/smb.conf
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo nano smb.conf

11. Then delete all the things inside smb.conf and then write:

    [samba_shared]
	comment = Welcome to samba
	path = /home/shibu/samba_shared
	browseable = yes
	read only = yes
	guest ok = no

Then ctrl x and then y and save the file. 

12. Now download smbclient if not there then the command is:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo apt-get -y install smbclient

13. Now start/stop services of both smbd and nmbd
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start smbd
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl stop nmbd

Also, check both smbd and nmbd statuses too

14. First do: 
    shibu@kali:~$ whoami

15. And then: 
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo pdbedit -a -u $(whoami)

16. Type and retype your password:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo pdbedit -L (to check all users)

17. This will make any connectionn possible to connect:
    $ sudo ufw allow from (your ip addr) any app Samba

    In my case it was:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.56.0/24 to any app Samba

18. To check for your ip then use this command : 
    shibu@kali:~$ ip a 		(OR) 
    shibu@kali:~$ ip addr

19. Now to reload your firewall use:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo ufw reload  

20. To check whether it's working or not, use:
    $ sudo smbcllient -U <username> -L  //your ip

    In my case it was:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo smbcllient -U shibu -L  //192.168.56.101

21. Now restart both smbd and nmbd services:
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl restart smbd
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl restart nmbd

22. Do also check their status 
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status smbd
    shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status nmbd


• Windows OS Part:

1. Once smbd and nmbd services are active now switch back to your windows OS and press windows + R key on keyboard and 
   now a pop up box will open and their write smbclient ip address, 
   here in my case it was //192.168.56.101 and press OK.

2. Now again one more pop up box will open, write the credentials of your Windows or Kali or whatever it would be.

3. Now in top of the address bar you can see Network > 192.168.56.101 (your ip address)
   in this you can see samba_shared and documents folder.

4. In samba_shared server you can see all the txt files that we've made earlier, using touch command.

5. Once all your samba_shared files are visible in windows, then the sharing of files/folders have been 
   successfully done between Windows and Kali Linux.
