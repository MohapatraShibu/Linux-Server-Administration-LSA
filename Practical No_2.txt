1. Addng a user: 
   A user is one who works on the machine simultaneously or it has the permissions to read, write and execute one file or all files.
   A user can be added individually or in a group.
   
   For addng a user individually, the command is : 
   $sudo adduser <username>
      
   Example: 
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo adduser lsa_user

      
2. Network settings: The ip address, ethernet connections and other network connections can be seen throgh using the command: 
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo ip a   	(OR)  
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo ip addr
    

3. Configuring services: 
   The services that run in the background are also known as daemons, services usually have a 'd' in last of their name to identify it as a daemon. 
   
   For example - smbd nmbd,etc
   The services are available in the /etc/ folder as mostly the services are available there 
   
   For example: 
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo view /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 
  
  
4. List of services running: The command to list the currently active and running services can be done:- 
   $sudo systemctl

a. Command to enable a service:                 
   $sudo systemctl enable <service_name>

   Example:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl enable ssh


b. Command to start a service:                  
   $sudo systemctl start <service_name>

   Example:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start ssh


c. Command to check the status of a service:    
   $sudo systemctl status <service_name>

   Example:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl status ssh


d. Command to stop a service:                   
   $sudo systemctl stop <service_name>

   Example:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl stop ssh


e. Command to auto-start a service: 
   $sudo systemctl restart <service_name>

   Example:
   shibu@kali:~$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
